Description:
A spoonerism is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched between two words in a phrase. 
For example,

    kite flying becomes fite klying

Your task is to create a function 'spoon' that takes a string of two words, separated by a space and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string, as in the above example.
Note: Input will always contain 2 words

Sample Input:
kite flying

Sample Output:
fite klying

Test Cases:

    Input#1:
    "not picking"

    Output#1:
    "pot nicking"


    Input#2:
    "horse riding"
    
    Output#2:
    "rorse hiding"

"not picking" => "pot nicking" // split(" ")
let splittedWords = ["not" , "picking"]

let firstCharOfFIrst = splittedWords[0][0]; //n
let firstCharOfSecond = splittedWords[1][0]; //p

let string = "p" + "ot" + "n"+"icking"
